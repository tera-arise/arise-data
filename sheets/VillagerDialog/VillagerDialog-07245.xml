        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="24">You must be exceptionally skilled to have made it this far.&lt;BR&gt;This place is called the &lt;font color='#0952D9'&gt;Koleogg Nest&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;Now, you may not believe this...but there are Giant Beetles here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You'll also find the &lt;font color='#0B57CA'&gt;Floating Stone&lt;/font&gt; buried under the nest.&lt;BR&gt; I don't know why the beetles like it so much, but they've killed everyone else who's tried to retrieve it.&lt;BR&gt;If you're looking for something powerful enough to float an &lt;font color='#0B57CA'&gt;Arc&lt;/font&gt;, it will probably do the trick.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good luck!</Page>
