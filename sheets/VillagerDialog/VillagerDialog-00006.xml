        <Page social="0">Troop buildup is proceeding apace. We've secured loyalty from the devas and have an arrangement with the kulkaris. Neither will be a problem.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The orcans in the Celestial Hills are more concerned with pillaging the remaining farm and harassing those federation fools. Our project in the south won't be disturbed. Unfortunately, we ran into a snag in Scarwood, but it can't be helped.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Come on, how do you get in?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0">Our mistress, Tetra Aniask, continues to gather magical power. She assures us that this vital step will ensure our master's resurrection, regardless of our efforts on the ground. We need only keep the federation from discovering the location of the bastion. Our teleportal helps with that, while keeping up the flow of arms. As our weapons build up, our allies grow, and our power reaches unimaginable heights, we will reshape this world as we wish and know our lord's gratitude!&lt;PREVPAGEBUTTON&gt;Read it again.&lt;/PREVPAGEBUTTON&gt;&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;"That's not good."&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
