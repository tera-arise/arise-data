        <Page social="4">Do you want to join the dig for gold? Goldwings go absolutely mad for Gold Leaves, don’t ask me why. Presumably they look good in their lairs. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bring me Gold Leaves between 10th and 15th September and I’ll help you to tame Goldwings. Use all 5 riding skills to receive the title Gold Digger.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In comparison to Fyraga over there, I eschew violence against these creatures. The dragons talk to us; we need but to open our hearts.</Page>
