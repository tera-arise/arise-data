        <Page social="4">It's not easy to live alone in this world. Come and see me whenever you wish to form a guild with your colleagues.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You do know that the what guild can do varies depending on the guild level, right? For example, guild items can't be used at all if the guild level is low. If you want to change your guild level, come and visit me any time. Of course, it's not free.</Page>
