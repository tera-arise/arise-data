        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">We are aman mercenaries, from Kaiator.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If there's a battle going on somewhere, I can guarantee you that you'll find an aman merc...probably on the front line.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And now there are rumors that the next ruler of Velika will be decided by battle. So we're looking for a guild that wants to win...and is willing to pay us to make that happen.</Page>
