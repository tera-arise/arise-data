The results were predictably...insane, and everyone who entered eventually went mad as well—in addition to undergoing physical changes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Members of the Mysterium went in to research, hoping to be gone before madness or metamorphosis set in...but the mad prince has now kidnapped Aliss, the chief researcher, and all of our rescue efforts have met with tragic defeat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You are our last hope. May the Goddess of Victory be with you!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I will be waiting for you...&lt;BR&gt;—Adonis&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Put away the letter.&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
