What could be causing such hostility?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perhaps the defiance and will of the human race remain here due to all the time they spent wandering.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Or perhaps, the souls of the elves are still among the lands of Arun, long before the humans settled down.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;...(letters are erased)...&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;Next page.&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Elves, the ancestors of the high elves, were quite different from the today's noble high elf. They were a hostile race, expanding their lands through conquest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the Flower of Life, the gift from Karas, was destroyed, they built a core, and split up along political lines into two factions. The high elves and the wind elves.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Later, the high elves built a prison here, somewhere near Velika's North Gate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Necromantic Conduit: a prison that people say no man can escape.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(Whoever wrote this must have fallen asleep just after that last line.)&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Stop reading.&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
