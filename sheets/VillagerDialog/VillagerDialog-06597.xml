        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Perhaps I could be better at giving advice, if all of these corpses are any indication. Let me try again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Should I shout "My shield will save me!" later, I am going to blast a huge area with my powers. Or maybe, if I'm lying, I'm really just going to protect myself with a shield!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you think I'm being truthful, you should get as far away as possible. But if you think I'm being dishonest, you should hammer my shield with everything you've got. Good luck guessing which is which!</Page>
