This song is actually a ceremonial song, sung when a male and female Tuwangi confirm each others' love.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I can't believe that Lakan created such creatures. However, after staying with the Tuwangis a while, I came to a conclusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Tuwangis might seem comical, but they are far from gentle.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;Next page.&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">The Tuwangi follow a class society. This being the case, when a Tuwangi tries to mate with a Tuwangi stronger then him or herself, the opponent instantly prepares for battle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once this happens, other Tuwangis gather around and start singing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With this in mind, the song is clearly not a love song, but is in fact a war song.&lt;BR&gt;I doubt that Lakan taught love to this race. My next destination is the Wendigo village.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Stop reading.&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
