        <Page social="4">I'm a collector, trading mysterious items from around the world. Do you find it strange that me and my brother have the same occupation? We're rivals in business, but blood is always thicker than water.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As we're speaking of him, I should mention that I have much more interesting goods on offer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do you want to trade with me?</Page>
