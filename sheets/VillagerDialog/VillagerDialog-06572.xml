There is a creature living in the sewer, despite feeding solely upon all the failed experimentation potions and the corpses of the failed experiments that I threw down there. It is a crab that serves as Yuanti's mount. I wonder how it got in the sewers. I did have one Yuanti which I had captured for my experiments...maybe the crab was his mount? At any rate, this is a fantastic opportunity to test my process on something that has already demonstrated its ability to survive the rigors of my alchemical experiments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Lab Report ADE-0620&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This crab is extremely resistant to toxins. It has so far not only survived every step of the process, but it seems to be thriving. I have noted a sharp increase in its size (as well as its appetite). I took a chance and implanted a more complex brain in the crab, and that gamble has paid off. The crab is now able to obey simple commands. It even speaks the language of the brain's donor. The next step is to subject it to chrysalis in the 'egg' I constructed..."</Page>
