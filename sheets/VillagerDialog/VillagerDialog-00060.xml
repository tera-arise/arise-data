Low visibility&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm still observing the Mournwings and Murderwings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was able to notice that one of the Mournwing's jewel glands has contracted.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I've been keeping an eye on the others, but only one of them was noticeable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I keep tracking the one with the contracted jewel gland and try to search for other unusual butterflies if possible.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;Go to next page&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Close the report&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Date unknown. High visibility&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I've been following the butterfly all night.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That particular butterfly flew off towards Exodor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was also able to witness a group of butterflies with contracted jewel glands flying towards Exodor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This can't be just a coincidence. I'm sure that this must be some kind of a homing instinct.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* Supplemental:&lt;BR&gt;I've reported this to the Mysterium.&lt;PREVPAGEBUTTON&gt;Go to previous page&lt;/PREVPAGEBUTTON&gt;&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;Go to next page&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Close the report&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Date unknown. High powder concentration.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Mysterium was impressed with my report and requested additional experiments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hung a heavily weighted sack to one of the butterflies with a contracted jewel gland to check if the weight creates any difficulties while flying.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Surprisingly, the butterfly was able to take its flight to Exodor without any trouble.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This should mean that anyone could take a flight to Exodor riding these butterflies.&lt;PREVPAGEBUTTON&gt;Go to previous page&lt;/PREVPAGEBUTTON&gt;&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Close the report&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
