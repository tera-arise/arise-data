        <Page social="0">Today I caught a glimpse of the argons' queen. They call her Shandra Manaya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That's rightâ€”they speak. Or the smart ones do. Calling it speech isn't quite right, though. To my ears, it's eerie clicking mixed with words.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Did Shandra Manaya create the argons? If so, she must be a goddess. What chance do we have against an immortal argon?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I heard them mention a "shaper," perhaps that one might have answers for me.&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Put message away.&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
