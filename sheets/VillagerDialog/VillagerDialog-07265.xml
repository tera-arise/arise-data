We don't know much about him, but we've seen that he can conjure up floods of lava through his servant, Duras!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you see it coming, look for those four grates. They're steam vents, and the steam comes out with so much force you might be able to propel yourself up above the lavaâ€”that is, if you can keep the demokrons from blocking the vents!</Page>
