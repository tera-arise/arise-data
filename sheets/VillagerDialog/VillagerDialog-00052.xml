        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Bad news. I've deduced that Gourdo is probably still alive and no longer at the academy. He's more dangerous than ordinary spirits, isn't he?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some advice: remember he can be placated. If you see him, try pumpkin pie. You can get it from major cities, and maybe the monsters have some as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best not to question why Gourdo—a pumpkin—wants pumpkin pie. I shudder to think of the answer. But try giving him some pie...see what that does.&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Pie it is, then."&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
