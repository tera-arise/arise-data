        <Page social="4">Hmph, why is everyone so impressed with Velika when it's clearly a big dump compared to Allemantheia. Nobody here knows what true refinement is. Actually, I wouldn't expect any of these lowbrows to know.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sigh, why was I cursed with being born here? Allemantheia is where I truly belong. I don't know how much longer I can put up with this abhorrent lack of culture.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, what is it that you want?</Page>
