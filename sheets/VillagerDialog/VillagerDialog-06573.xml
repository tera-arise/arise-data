        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Another memo from Dakuryon's research:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Lab Report ADE-1231&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have acquired some of Banyakas's seeds. The seeds were provided by some captives, who claimed that they found it in some kind of a temple. Unfortunately, they did not choose to divulge this information until they were nearly dead, so I was unable to ask them more specific questions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Fortunately, the experiment with the seeds was successful. Once subjected to my process, the seeds took root and grew quickly into a mighty tree. I of course upgraded its rudimentary nervous system to include a brain.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Interestingly, the tree has learned to use its sap as a weapon, and can create slaves, both to serve it...and feed it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I can replicate this process, I would become godlike!"</Page>
