She was stabbed 14 times with a small, bladed weapon, 5 times in the front and 9 in the back.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Today is--was her 18th birthday, and we have no idea who could have done this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The victim was last seen leaving a diplomatic event hosted by federation Magister Ivory the night before, by a young popori by the name of "Chip" Mcguffins. He claims to have seen her in conversation with Ivory, but no other witnesses can confirm his statement.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;View the Evidence&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
