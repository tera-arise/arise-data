But instead, they were the beginning of the terrible disaster. The mysterious glowing red light should have been a warning, but I dismissed my uneasiness due to time pressures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was so wrong.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just after we placed the statues, we found their first victim. At first we thought Thantil committed suicide. But it didn't take long before more were dead. The town was in chaos.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I gathered the bravest townsfolk. During that meeting, we heard a big boom from the shore. From the hall, I could see two gigantic monsters lumbering toward the statues. They butchered everyone along their path and stacked the bodies among the statues. These statues are the curse of our town.</Page>
