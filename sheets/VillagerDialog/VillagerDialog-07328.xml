After Lakan destroyed the bridge to the Sanctuary, he twisted Velik's defenses to foil teleport spells.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But there is another way: A pegasus can fly around the defenses, as well as the bulk of Lakan's forces.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We can summon the pegasi for you when you are ready. But we must remain here to summon them back so that Seir's forces can join you, when they arrive.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quickly, now! Take the pegasi to &lt;font color='#0000FF'&gt;Velik's Sanctuary - Garden&lt;/font&gt;!</Page>
