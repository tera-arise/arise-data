        <Page social="4">Here's some advice: keep your eyes on your opponents and your feet moving at all times.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your foe announces actions by body positioning. The bigger the attack, the more obvious the signs. If your foe is building to a big hit, it's vulnerable. Make the most of the chances you get.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even alone, you can outlast anything by wearing it down. Keep moving, and you'll keep breathing.</Page>
