        <Page social="0">Lady Akia,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have selected and dispatched some our best fighters to the northeast as you requested. Spare no whip and do as you wish with them, for they are your most loyal servantsâ€”more than ready to lay down their lives for you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On a separate note, it appears those federation fools continue to defy us. Although they are no match against our forces, I fear an attempt may be made to locate your camp while we are kept busy defending the main base. Rest assured, I will take all necessary steps to safeguard your location.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your Loyal Servant, Basenius</Page>
