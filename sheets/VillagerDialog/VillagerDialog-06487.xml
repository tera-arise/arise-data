        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="24">I'm guessing you've come in search of the Floating Stone. It's here, hidden deep within the caves on the far side of the ravine. But if you expect to go any further, first heed my advice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This area is perilously close to the Rift's Edge, and there are things hereabouts that thrive on the divine energies just under the surfaceâ€”such as in the caves. You'll encounter monsters both familiar and alien, and you cannot reach your goal without first defeating them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Start with the &lt;font color='#0B57CA'&gt;Guwangi Village&lt;/font&gt; here, and &lt;font color='#FF0000'&gt;focus on killing weaker monsters first.&lt;/font&gt; The gatekeepers are hard enough to defeat, without calling down the wrath of the entire village while you're at it.</Page>
