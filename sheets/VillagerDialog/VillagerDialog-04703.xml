        <Page social="4">Essenia Fortress was built to provide a launching off point for an invasion of Allemantheia. If we can capture it, turn it to our use, we'll have a powerful weapon to protect Southern Shara.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We certainly can't let Thulsa keep it. He tried to capture Kaiator once. We don't need to give him another chance.</Page>
