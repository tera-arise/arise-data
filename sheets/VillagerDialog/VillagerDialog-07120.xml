        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">The Valkyon Federation uses pegasi to travel long distances, where walking might not be an optionâ€”such as from here to Velika. We use these platforms as landing pads...and we have them in every city and major village from here to Kaiator.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To take a pegasus to another platform, you just talk to the flight manager, and point out on the map where you want to go. If you're not yet authorized for a destination, you won't be able to select it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just let me know when you're ready to depart.)</Page>
