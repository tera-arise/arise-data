Welcome to my playground!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You aren't the first to read these words, but so many who came before were just too fragile. They didn't last. So let me give you a hint:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I shout "I will kill you all!" then if you're inside the orange circle, you're pretty much dead.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unless I'm lying, of course, in which case the only safe place to be is inside the orange circle!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I leave it up to you to figure out whether or not I'm lying!</Page>
