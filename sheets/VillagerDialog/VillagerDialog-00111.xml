I've shared your cover story about being a recruit on the Island of Dawn, but some people are still suspicious.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We're doing our best to track down the traitor, but it's going to take some time. Until then, your real story is classified.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll do my best to protect you from federation politics, but I recommend you get out of the city and back into the field as soon as possible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;â€”Dougal&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Close the letter.&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
