Come on in, and take a look around! You can watch thrilling matches &lt;font color='#0000FF'&gt;between 5 and 10 p.m. Pacific nightly&lt;/font&gt;, so be on time! We'll have gold ticket matches every ten minutes, and one diamond ticket match every hour, at ten 'til!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bookies will be taking bets right before each match begins—and taking breaks between matches.</Page>
