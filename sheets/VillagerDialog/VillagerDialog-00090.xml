Because this is widely known, a number of craftsmen are traveling to the temple for those materials, and so I must hurry to get there first.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I will write to you once I have secured the ore.&lt;BR&gt;May the gods grant me swift travel!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Karakhir&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Hand the letter back to Seir.&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
