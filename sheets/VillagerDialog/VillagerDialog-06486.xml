        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="249">Have you come seeking the Floating Stone?&lt;BR&gt;So many attempt this task, but seldom more than once.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the &lt;font color='#0B57CA'&gt;Medium Path&lt;/font&gt;. To reach your goal, you'll need the assistance of someone on the Cliff Path as well.&lt;BR&gt;If you doubt your abilities, you may want to reconsider your plan. The challenges on this path are unpredictable, and intense.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To open the door, you'll need &lt;font color='#FF0000'&gt;2 teams.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One to &lt;font color='#FF0000'&gt;destroy the monument on this path,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and another to do the same on the Cliff Path.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fair warning, the monsters here are much stronger&lt;BR&gt;than those in other regions. So be careful!</Page>
