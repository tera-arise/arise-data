        <Page social="0">Dear Arin,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I should have known a sly fox like you would try to trick me the same way you tricked the council into voting for your flag design—with magic. Well, I didn't drink your potion, and I won't accept your flag. If our beloved goddess Elinu were here today, I'm confident she would agree with me that our flag should proudly display a squirrel.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for my army, they are no longer under my control. Rhokasi the Mad has turned them into a murderous horde, and much as it pains me to say it, I need your help breaking his spell—you're the only one I know who can.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your loving sister,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rida&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;P.S. I demand a new ballot.&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;"She never gives up."&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
