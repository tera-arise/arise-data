        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">It's been 500 days since I met Elleon.&lt;BR&gt;They say that Elleon refused to be the head of his family, but I know that's not the truth.&lt;BR&gt;Elleon doesn't know his numbers so he couldn't even if he wanted to. All he knows about is battle and swords.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I guess they don't teach math at the Mysterium.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once, he came back with a dirty sword.&lt;BR&gt;He said that the owner sold it in a hurry and it's almost impossible to get a quality sword at that price.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rubbish. I'm sure that someday he'll end up dying on a battlefield. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The man that sold the sword must have no conscience whatsoever.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;Next page.&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">I felt pity for Elleon, so I told him that I'll sharpen the sword for him. He said that he would hunt some monsters first.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With that pathetic sword, he still slaughtered those monsters.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Slaughtered them good.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He might not know numbers, but he's one amazing swordsman. I hope he never finds out I wrote this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(The next page is torn off.)&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Stop reading.&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
