Words alone cannot express our gratitude.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The goddess is weakened from her ordeal, but her wounds are not critical.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Still, Lakan's dark power has not dissipated. I can feel it all around us. Until it is gone, the sanctuary is not a safe place for Velik.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We will escort her someplace safe until she can recover.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you again. Your bravery is truly legendary.</Page>
