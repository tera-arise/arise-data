        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="132">When the giants of old were overthrown, the gods smashed their cities to the rubble you see all throughout this land. This castle, though, rose from beneath the sea, even as every other building crumbled.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A curiosity, to be sure, which is why so many young baraka archaeologists come to this areaâ€”despite the danger.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I myself spend a great deal of time here, in hopes of learning something...but I find myself mainly just enjoying the view.</Page>
