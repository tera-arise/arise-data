The Commanders disappeared a long time ago thanks to the guardians, but there have been reports of unnerving earthquakes and loud explosions here. Could you please investigate this place?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You can move to the "&lt;font color='#0000FF'&gt;Commanderâ€™s Residence&lt;/font&gt;" by talking to me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;font color='#FF0000'&gt;- The Commander will awake when a raid group of 20 players enters this dungeon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Adventure Coins and Entry count required.&lt;/font&gt;</Page>
