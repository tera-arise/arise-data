        <Page social="4">Do you want the gift of the gab?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Exchange Silver Dust for Silverwings from me between 1st and 6th October. Learn and use all 5 riding skills to receive the Silver-Tongued title.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Silverwings are fascinating subjects for study. They’re proud, intelligent, and have a silver tongue, or so people say. It’s a tricky prospect divesting them of their magic.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, I’ve discovered that they’re more than partial to a bit of Silver Dust. When I give them that, they answer all of my questions. Well… most of them.</Page>
