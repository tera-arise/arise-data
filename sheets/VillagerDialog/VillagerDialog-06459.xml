        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Oh! Are you here to rescue me? Well, you'll have to get through the &lt;font color='#0080FF'&gt;Solonesome Cage&lt;/font&gt; first.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Past those guards, see the big iron cage? You have to defeat the golem inside to leaveâ€”but only one person can go into the cage. Everyone else should climb into the &lt;font color='#FF0000'&gt;siege weapons&lt;/font&gt; and take out as many of the remaining monsters as possible. &lt;b&gt;Defeat enough, and you'll receive special boosts.&lt;/b&gt;</Page>
