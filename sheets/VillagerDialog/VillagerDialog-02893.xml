        <Page social="4">Welcome! You have found the Order of the Dragon. For many years now we have been watching from the shadows, guiding the destiny of Arborea. Now that you’ve found us, you deserve to learn something about our work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My brothers and sisters are scholars studying the various species of dragon. Talk to them if you want to attract dragons of specific colors. My passions lie elsewhere: I’m more interested in the magical properties that dwell within these beasts, whatever the species.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What’s it to you? Hah, you heroes are always so practical… well, let me tell you. Tame and mount the following dragons, and I’ll give you a matching title:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Collect all mythical dragons to get the title: Mythical Dragon Hunter&lt;BR&gt;- Collect all fabled dragons to get the title: Fabled Dragon Lord&lt;BR&gt;- Collect all legendary dragons to get the title: Legendary Dragon Master&lt;BR&gt;- Collect all almighty dragons to get the title: Almighty Dragon Sovereign&lt;BR&gt;- Collect all 25 dragons to get the title: Grandmaster of the Dragon Order</Page>
