        <Page social="0">My power grows and grows. No one here can understand its depths, much less surpass me in a contest of skills. My chaos spell is far beyond the abilities of my finest teachers, and I intend to unleash it on the entire castle. I can't wait to see their faces go white with shock and red with anger.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And now there's a voice that keeps urging me to break the sealing spells on the Altar of Vadoma. But that's what keeps the demons away! Why won't the voice leave me alone?! Oh, it's starting againâ€”I can't make it stop telling me "Break the seals! Break the seals!"&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;"The voice must have driven her mad."&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
