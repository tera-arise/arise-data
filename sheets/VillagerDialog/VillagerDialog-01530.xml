        <Page social="4">Welcome! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That's right. You can immediately notice that this is not your everyday equipment, right? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The equipment laid before you is specially made by well-known artisans. I'm sure you've heard of Nepir or Shan, right?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh, no. I'm sorry, but you can't buy these items with money. These items were specially ordered to give as rewards to whoever collects and brings back the &lt;font color='#FF0000'&gt;gelid badges&lt;/font&gt; to our shop.</Page>
