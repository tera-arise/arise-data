        <Page social="4">You like my kitty?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I also have these funny little creaturesâ€”go everywhere with me. Tiny brains, but they're sharp. A little training, and they can snatch items from the packs of unsuspecting strangers. Not that I promote such things.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They can be very useful. Too bad they smell awful. I see your nose twitching, it's not me, I swear.</Page>
