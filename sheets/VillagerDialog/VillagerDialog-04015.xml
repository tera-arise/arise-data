        <Page social="4">Greetings! Such a perfect day for diving for oysters and Corallium, wouldn’t you agree? At least, it is if you’re not trying to make a living of it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The demand for Corallium is growing daily in Allemantheia. I can barely keep up with my order list; no sooner have I come up from a dive than I need to head back into the water. I could use a break…&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you find any Corallium, I’ll gladly take it off your hands. My customers pay good money for the ocean’s bounties, and I hate to disappoint them. Of course, I’ll give you a fair cut. How does 30% sound?</Page>
