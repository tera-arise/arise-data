        <Page social="5" voiceTypeId="8">The Lightkeepers live by a simple code. This, is the Cursus Honorum.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. When the powerful band together, their only goal should be to promote the greater good.&lt;BR&gt;2.

Those who follow the rules should be rewardedâ€”those who break them, left behind.&lt;BR&gt;4. Nakatam Tower must be defended at all costs, lest the relics within be used for evil.&lt;BR&gt;5.
