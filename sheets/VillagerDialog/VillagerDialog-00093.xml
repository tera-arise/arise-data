What difference does that make? I'm picked it up first!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The aman brought up an idea and said, "Let's settle this down with a one-punch fist fight. We hit each other once and the winner keeps the hammer!"&lt;BR&gt;"Fine!" The castanic did not hesitate to accept the challenge.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;Next page.&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">The two flipped a coin to choose who goes first. The coin was in the castanic's favor.&lt;BR&gt;"May the honor of Kaiator be with me!" the aman prayed, and prepared for the blow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The castanic was filled with joy, as if he were a little child. Spitting on his fist, the castanic punched the aman in the face with all his might.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The aman passed out. It took him nearly an hour to get back up on his feet. "Prepare yourself, castanic. It's my turn now!" The aman flexed his muscles, eager to punch the castanic.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With a smirk on his face, the castanic said, "That's okay...you can have the hammer."&lt;CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;Stop reading.&lt;/CLOSEPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
