        <Page social="4">Before you go...just one more thing. I have a tuwangi contact here. I'm sure he's fine, but...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Maybe you could find {@LinkCreature:205#1016#Jirra} for me and make sure he's all right?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oh, and if he's in trouble, give him this scroll. He can use it to teleport somewhere safe.</Page>

Oh, yes! Thank you, thank you!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Go see my brother, {@LinkCreature:205#1003#Pangari}. He is southeast of here. Let him know I'm safe!</Page>

        <Page social="0">Thank you for helping Jirra escape! Things here have gotten much worseâ€”three tribes, all fighting to expand the swamp, but fighting each other!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tuwangis fighting tuwangis is not right. Not right at all. No one can trust anyone else! I had to run but my brother was left behind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm so grateful you got him out. Thank you.</Page>
