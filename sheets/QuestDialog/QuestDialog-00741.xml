        <Page social="4">Those wrecks were gula merchant ships. Should be full of boring stuff like rations, lumber, and grain. But we found a manifest that says there are gold coins in the cargo hold. Gold!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I know the sailors are all undead monsters now, but wouldn't you have grabbed the coins before you ran aground? Kill the {@LinkCreature:31#12#drowned gula sailors} and {@LinkCreature:31#14#bosuns} and see what they're carrying in their pockets!</Page>
