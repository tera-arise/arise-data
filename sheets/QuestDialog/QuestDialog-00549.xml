        <Page social="4">I saw something disturbing in the &lt;font color='#660000'&gt;Howling Vale&lt;/font&gt;. Two creatures of the same species fought each other and the victor ate the flesh of the loser.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is not normal behavior and may be worth investigating.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What could we do?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4">Our magic may shed light on this phenomenon. Hunt the {@LinkCreature:21#4#brutal orisks} and collect samples from them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bring them back and we'll see if we can find what drove them to such unusual behavior.</Page>

        <Page social="10">I hope this wasn't too taxing. The desert is vast and dangerous.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You have the samples? Let me see them. Stand back, now. This could get a bit messy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By the gods! The scent in these samples almost overwhelmed me! I must rest for now. Incredible. My nose may never forgive me.</Page>
