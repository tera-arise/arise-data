        <Page social="5">Our well used to supply enough water for all of us, but the drought has taken its tollâ€”and now the kulkari keep stealing our water supplies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a tent camp to the west of the village. It was once the village market, but it's been abandoned because of the bandits. There may be some water left there, but none of us are equipped to handle the bandits.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can you go check and bring back any water you find?</Page>

        <Page social="5">Well done! This is plenty of water. It may not last us through the drought, but it should last a while.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Thank you. The federation sends more like you, and I'll be glad we joined forces.</Page>
