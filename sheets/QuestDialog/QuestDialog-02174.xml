        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">This place is heavily guarded. An ordinary naga, such as I, can only come this far.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyplace beyond the platform is restricted. The only nagas permitted to enter are the ones that closely aid the draakons. I won't be any help from now on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Past the Control Center you'll find Vogzu. He's waiting for you.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">I assume your friend Elleon went into the fortress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most of the guards at the Control Center hurried to the fortress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fortress was already a difficult place to sneak in. Now, it's almost impossible. We should disguise as draakons.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"How do we do that?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0">The disguise will take care of our looks, but what really matters is our smell.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Without changing our odor, it's only a matter of time before the guards realize that we're not draakons.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Go gather some Exodor Metal Fragments and Rotted Mucus. With those ingredients, I can make a perfect disguise.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Please defeat the wretches that betrayed my people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Although they betrayed us, it's difficult for us to kill our own people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll deliver the disguise to Jelena and Titus right away as soon as it is ready. I'll have them wait for you at the Dark Gate.</Page>
