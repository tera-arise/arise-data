        <Page social="0">After finding orbless draakon corpses near Rogash's Manor, you conducted some investigations. Rogash had been absorbing draakons' orbs to enhance his own strength. After defeating Rogash, the guardian's group returned to base. However, they couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that was left following the destruction of the core in Exodor.</Page>
