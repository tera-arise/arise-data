        <Page social="5">I need my messenger Jadan to deliver a package that just arrived, but he's nowhere to be found in the village.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;PCNAME&gt;, can you go ask {@LinkCreature:67#1008$$Okon} at the northern gate if he saw Jadan leave?</Page>

        <Page social="5">Jadan? No, I haven't seen him pass by today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Check with {@LinkCreature:67#1019#Kripa} over there, though, just to be sure.</Page>

        <Page social="5">Jadan is dead? That's horrible. Strange things are happening lately, that's for sure. We should initiate a buddy system.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But wait, where's his son, Dipa?</Page>
