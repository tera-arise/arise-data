        <Page social="4">My colleague, Neria, has misplaced her assistant, Timuron. He went into the cemetery to collect his own samples. Smart lad, and brave. He's overdue though, and I worry he's in over his head. Could you look for him? I'm sure she's worried about the lad.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Esedran sent you? Velik be praised!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I've been testing various compounds on remnants of the dead I could get my hands on. Neria can probably glean more from this than you or I could.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Would you mind taking it to her? I'm going to stay here and see if I can find out anything else.</Page>
