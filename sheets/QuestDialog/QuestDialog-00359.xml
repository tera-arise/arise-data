        <Page social="4">Oh, actually I have another job for you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;{@LinkCreature:13#301194#Stonebeak highcrests} have been stealing research equipment and ruining some sensitive measurements on the northeast edge of our base.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Go and see whether you can get some of the &lt;b&gt;research tools&lt;/b&gt; back.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you've got a good supply, take them to Jarius.</Page>

        <Page social="4">This is a welcome surprise! I've been walking around, trying to think of how to complete my research on this magnificent tree structure here. Every time I set these instruments up, these stonebeaks come and steal them. I wonder why....&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, thank you very much for your help.</Page>

I ask because you don't seem to have what the {@LinkCreature:13#301194#stonebeak highcrests} stole.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have occasion to hit them with weapons or something, I'd really appreciate getting those instruments back...</Page>
