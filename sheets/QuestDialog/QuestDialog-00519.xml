        <Page social="0">Rotting bodies everywhere I look. What's worse, they never stop moving. You have to do something.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;{@LinkCreature:20#30011002#Cruel taskmasters} and {@LinkCreature:20#30011001#slave overseers} have been forcing the {@LinkCreature:20#30039000#zomporis} to mine thermionic deposit nodes around here for quite some time. I don't know what they intend to do with all that ore, but history tells me the answer won't make me dance for joy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Get rid of them all—slaves and masters alike—and collect any thermionic deposit nuggets they've gathered. Studying the nuggets might tell us what they're up to.</Page>
