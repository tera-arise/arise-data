        <Page social="4">This place was once the center of the giants' empire. It's ruined now, of course, but...it was once so great.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's so exciting to be among so much history! I'm here studying the ancient cityâ€”or I was before the kulkaris arrived.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As soon as they're gone, though...I'll be back out there.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Can I help in the meantime?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0">Well, I can't get back to my research unless I explore outside the camp. If you're willing to brave it, you could investigate the giants' relics in Mags Kurata to the north and Mags Kuchanaru to the west.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Any fragments with anything that looks like writing would be wonderful.</Page>
