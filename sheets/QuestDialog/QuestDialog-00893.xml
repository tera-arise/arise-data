        <Page social="5">It's bad enough that you can't tell day from night in the crypt. But those destroyers will keep you from getting any rest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Killian left them behindâ€”something about stealing the rest of Saleron's power.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And if you see any of our scouts, tell them to return to base. We don't need scouts to tell us these crypts are endless and overrun with the enemy.</Page>

        <Page social="6">Return to camp? Fine by me!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I've got news to report anyway: It's not just Killian's minions down here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The argons are down deeper...and I've even seen them up here on occasion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So yes, I'll return to base. I'm a scout, not a martyr.</Page>
