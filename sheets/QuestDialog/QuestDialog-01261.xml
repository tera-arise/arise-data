        <Page social="5">Darekuur, the so-called "Slaughterer of Mad Laughter," was the leader of the bandits. He was as cruel as his nickname was ridiculous—until I cut his head off a few years ago.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, Thulsa re-attached the head and brought Darekuur back with his necromancy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How'd you like to prove your bravery to me? Cutting Darekuur's head off won't be too difficult, and "Darekuur the Twice-Beheaded" isn't nearly as scary.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Huh. Ugly, ain't he?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm glad he's dead. I can still hear his creepy, chilling laughter in my ears.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now you and I have something in common—we've both cut Darekuur's head off!</Page>
