        <Page social="4">The {@LinkCreature:31#22#frosthowl sirens} rampaging around the coast have stirred up quite a chilly breeze with their cries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the temperature around here gets any colder, the explorers out on the shipwrecks will freeze to death! Killing the frosthowl sirens won't warm things up, but it should keep it from getting any colder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After you're done, could you check on Tantan at the camp on the south of Frostclaw Lake? Make sure his explorers are all right.</Page>
