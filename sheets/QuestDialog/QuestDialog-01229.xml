        <Page social="4">I lost a lot of brave vanguards out here. The wendigos slaughtered them, probably thanks to that wicked argon glass thingâ€”the pylon?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At any rate, I can't recover their effects so long as the wendigos patrol the area.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I need you to take them out. It's going to be a long fight, but you can do it.</Page>

        <Page social="4">I don't care if the wendigos are Thulsa's thralls or not. They killed my people and stood in our way of dealing with the god of death. They had to go.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I appreciate your help. The condolence letters are easier to write if I have something to send with it.</Page>
