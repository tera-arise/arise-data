        <Page social="4">Question for you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Do you think it would hurt more to be eviscerated, or have the fingers on your left hand chopped off one by one? Sure, the former would probably kill you, but see, that's why I think it would hurt less.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Why the left hand? I thought that would be obvious—he's left-handed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Will you ask {@LinkCreature:63#3003#Elthienne} what she thinks?</Page>

        <Page social="4">She asked what? That kid's going be the death of me. Although I guess it's not me I should be worried about at the moment. Her boyfriend must have really done something bad this time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In other news, the Hands need someone to head to Basilisk Crag on a little hunting trip. Interested?</Page>
