        <Page social="5">The vampirs used to drink swine blood. So, what, they got tired of it? We just looked too tasty?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I need to know how far-spread among them this is. Believe it or not, they were friendly with us once.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I need you to collect hearts from {@LinkCreature:16#2201#vampir henchmen} and {@LinkCreature:16#2202#retiariuses}. Then I'll be able to see what they've been drinking.</Page>

        <Page social="5">You got these from the vampirs? You're absolutely sure? But they're completely dry. These hearts haven't seen blood in quite some time. Unusual, to say the least.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How are they surviving without blood? What did they do with Jadan's blood, if not drink it?</Page>
