        <Page social="4">Even with the resources of the federation behind us, we depend on civilians like Banker &lt;b&gt;Kerson&lt;/b&gt; to help with services like mail delivery and transporting supplies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To keep this relationship strong, we often "lend" people out for special favors.

        <Page social="4">Attend! I have a problem. Chione's a pilot who flies one of those airships around the island.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At least...she did before she crashed it heading to the Tainted Gorge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She's still out there dealing with her mistake, but I've got mail stacking up, and Ramun won't carry it in his pack.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chione's route goes east from here, then curves to the south. Find out what the holdup is—my reputation's at risk!</Page>
