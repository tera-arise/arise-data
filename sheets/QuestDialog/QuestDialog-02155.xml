        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">According to Jelena, there are two main areas in this place. A manor and a garden.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Titus and the villagers should be somewhere pass the garden.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;PCNAME&gt;, I want you to create a distraction so I can go deep inside.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Leave it to me."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Amarre should stay here. The nagas are far too dangerous for her.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;PCNAME&gt;, would you explain that to Amarre.</Page>

Thanks to your distraction, I was able to fully examine the garden and these guards.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I am correct, the captured villagers are behind that door.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But it seems a naga's identification tag is required to open that door.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;PCNAME&gt;, would you get the tag?</Page>
