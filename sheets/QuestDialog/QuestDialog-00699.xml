        <Page social="1">You must help me, &lt;PCNAME&gt;! I need you...I need you to poison me!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wait, don't go! I can explain. I need to be poisoned by a {@LinkCreature:30#140#venomous tentacullar} right away.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"By the titans, why?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">I have a dark secretâ€”something truly important that I cannot reveal to anyone. Alais and the goons from the Mysterium are going to force it out of me. The right dose of {@LinkCreature:30#140#venomous tentacullar} poison acts on the brain and causes memory loss. I'd rather be forgetful than dead.</Page>

        <Page social="1">(He chugs the poison in the bottle and then opens and closes his mouth several times, increasingly panic-stricken.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(He points to his mouth, gesticulates wildly, and then points to another miner.)</Page>

        <Page social="1">He drank what? No wonder he can't speak.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;His throat will swell to the point where he'll have trouble breathing for days. What happened?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"He was trying to forget a big secret..."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">That old wives' tale about tentacullar venom? He won't forget the past, but he won't be able to give up his precious secret, either.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Somebody has to tell {@LinkCreature:230#1065$$Libinienn} about this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We miners have an old custom, called "one-two-three-not-it," so you get to go tell Libinienn how you poisoned one of the miners.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good luck with that, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.</Page>

        <Page social="1">So you gave him tentacullar venom. And he drank it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I...I...words fail me.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I was just trying to help."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">You'll do anything someone asks you to do, eh?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You want to know what his big secret is? He's been taking some of our finds from the dig site and hiding them for black-market confederates to pick up.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And you delayed the interrogation he so richly deserves!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I'm sorry."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1">Well, you're naive, but you're no criminal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And come to think of it, you probably punished him worse by poisoning him than I would have.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you're an itinerant miner, getting sentenced to hard labor isn't much of a punishment.</Page>
