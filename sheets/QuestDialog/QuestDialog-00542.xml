        <Page social="4">My research partner, Aresk, and I are studying these relics. Unfortunately, we had a bit of a tiff and he stormed off. The desert is too dangerous to handle alone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I need you to check out the ruins and see if he's sulking there. Bring him back alive, please!</Page>

        <Page social="4">Hmph. Ladya sent you? I tried so hard to avoid the kulkari that I completely forgot about what we were fighting about.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks for coming after me. I'll make a few notes, then head back.</Page>
