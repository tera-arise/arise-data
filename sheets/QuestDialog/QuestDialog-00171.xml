You certainly impressed him, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Why don't you deliver this little epistle to Samael? He's as hard to win over as Mattin, but if anything can do it, it's this report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well done, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. This is exactly the kind of action we need from our soldiers right now.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Hmm. Well, this is quite a report. I guess you're not the keener I took you for. I underestimated you. I guarantee I won't do that again in the future.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We need more than just soldiers, we need leaders. Dougal thinks you're ready for a commission. I'm hardly going to argue against it, not after deeds such as these. Come, it's not every day you get to be a hero.</Page>
