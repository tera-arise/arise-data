Their wagons are stolen or wrecked, but the peddlers could still get their goods to Crescentia if someone would escort them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even a little shipment would be a real relief. You're looking for the {@LinkCreature:203#1028#peddler} east of here. Hurry up and don't let him die!</Page>
