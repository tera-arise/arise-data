        <Page social="4">Well met, soldier! What do you have there? Hey, those aren't federation goodsâ€”that brand's a kulkari marking! And that smell.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Looks like they're not just driving the kobolds to attack but supplying them with explosives as well. Now I'm SURE we need to break the kulkari's hold on the creatures.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Do you have a plan?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0">I have dozens of plans! Whatever we dream, the federation can do, right?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The trouble is while the amani here are willing to give the federation the benefit of the doubt, the chieftains are skeptical. Our job here is critical, but I'd be lying if I said it was easy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Right now, I just need someone to bring proof that we're doing something about the {@LinkCreature:24#15#sandpaw hyenas} and {@LinkCreature:24#106#Sand Wind reapers}, while I try to convince Turrek to share his supplies.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Excellent job, soldier. This should give Turrek and the other chieftains something to consider. And if not, we've at least given the kulkari and their minions some pause.</Page>
