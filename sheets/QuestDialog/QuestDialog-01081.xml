        <Page social="4">In this part of Raga Evala, the argons were doing some sort of strange botanical research. They gathered, and apparently argonized, some faeriesâ€”probably for their close connection to the natural world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You could never get me to harm a faerie creature in the real world, but in here everything's backward and upside-down.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can you obtain the horns of the argonomorph jalmaraks? Maybe I can come up with some sort of cure for argonification.</Page>

        <Page social="4">This kind of research isn't easy, and it's not exactly the safest laboratory I've ever worked in.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Still, the argons may be monstrous horrors from another dimension, but you have to admire their knack for botany.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I wish you could stay, but while you were out, we got a message from Soulsurge Chamber. They need your help.</Page>
