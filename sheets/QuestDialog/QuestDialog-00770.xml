        <Page social="4">The mercenary camp is somehow receiving regular reinforcements, but we don't know how or where they're coming from. No matter how many we kill, their numbers aren't shrinking.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No matter how many mercenaries there are, though, they're useless without their commanders.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We just have to find out where the commanders are camped.

I can't wait to tell Nashwa her plan paid off.</Page>
