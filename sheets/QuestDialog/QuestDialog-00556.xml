        <Page social="4">I hate to ask, but a Mysterium operative sneaked past our lines and headed into southern Basilisk Crag.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He might be dead or he might be some kulkari's dinner. If you could find him and bring him back, I'd be grateful.</Page>

Blast it, I warned him about going in there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now you know why we've tried to keep the Mysterium out of here in the first place!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm sorry he's dead, but at least we can tell his family what happened. Thanks.</Page>
