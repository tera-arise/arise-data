        <Page social="5">Don't be afraid. Batooni not here to kill you. I love peace. Would you help me?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There's a place called the Tuwangi Mire south of here. Tuwangis were living peacefully there. But the stonehammer tuwangis tricked tuwangis to turn against the humans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I will take you to a place called the Marshlands. I can take you there at a blink of an eye, and you can meet with {@LinkCreature:205#1017#Rathe}. Tell him you're there to help tuwangis.</Page>

        <Page social="5">A tuwangi riding a huge toad sent you? Oh, my, not again...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It may be an urgent issue for them, but ten people a week come here because of him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Who cares if the tuwangi tribes riot against each other? Those little frog-looking things act like they're the center of the world, but all they do is wander around in a pack and strike drums.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, you're here, so I'd appreciate it if you'd help out here at the camp. Beats looking at the "scenery"â€”a soggy marsh covered in mud.</Page>
