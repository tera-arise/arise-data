        <Page social="4">How can I think of war when all my heart thinks of is Nashwa?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I would throw myself headlong into battle to win her interest, but she is too distracted by our weapons shortage to notice anything.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hear Acarum arms their recruits by raiding mercenary camps. Could you do that for us?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We don't have soldiers to spare for such a mission, but if you hit the camps, the {@LinkCreature:32#8#Stalker Company destroyers} should have weapons enough for our recruits. Then Nashwa will be free to think about other things...like me!</Page>

        <Page social="4">What kind of fool does he think I am? Khasib just brought me a pile of weapons as if they were a bouquet of flowers. What did he think I would do?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We're in the middle of a war and he's acting like a schoolboy. I think I let him down too gently. Next time I'm not going to be so patient.</Page>
