        <Page social="5">Cultists neglect the land and murder our stewards. See the southwest there? Every day I watch those fat boars root up the plants and foul the soil. Farmland into dust pits! Hogs should be in the woods where they belong. Never would have happened before.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can't run them off because it's not the army's job! Have me killing my neighbors instead! Nature's upside down.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kept some money from my last harvest before...this. Kill those {@LinkCreature:17#300050#wary gutspiller warthogs} and {@LinkCreature:17#104#forked tusk warthogs}, and it's yours.</Page>
