        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">Ryshan told us that someone in the refugee camp has been picking fleabane flowers for their own benefit. We actually need those to help make the treatment for the people who are afflicted.&lt;BR&gt;It's selfish, but understandable. People are scared... not thinking clearly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Still, we must find out who it was, so we can put a stop to it. Please help us, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">We researchers have a potion that we call Remembrancer. When you drink it, it makes you re-experience old memories, particularly if someone provides a key word, like &amp;quot;mother&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;birthday&amp;quot;...or, in this case, &amp;quot;fleabane.&amp;quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With a strong enough dose, they'll get lost in their memories and start acting out whatever events they associate with that word.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's otherwise pretty harmless...but funny at parties.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If we use it wisely, it should act a bit like a truth serum.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"If that's what it takes..."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">I wish it weren't.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, I'll need Basilisk Blood and Burnt Arbosk Bark to make a batch of Remembrancer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll need plenty of them, to make sure there's enough to have the desired effect.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Wonderful!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll mix it in with the plague medication, and everyone who takes it will be receptive to the trigger word &amp;quot;fleabane&amp;quot;...and one of those people will have a memory of stealing it.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Why that word?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">That's the ingredient that went missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Okay, take these and give them to everyone in the camp.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then, after they take it, just say the word "fleabane" to them.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">I...uh...wow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hey, Niniel, you shouldn't touch those fleabanes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They're beautiful, but poisonous.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll find you a much prettier flower.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Oh, okay...uh...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They won't even notice it's gone, and we'll replace it before they do inventory.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It won't cure the crystallization, but if you mix it with milk, it helps soften your skin. It should slow down the crystallization...give me more time.</Page>

    <Text id="10" huntingZoneId="38" prevId="9" villagerId="120">
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">So, Hanhi confessed?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's a matter for the authorities, not the Mysterium... but I see no reason not to continue treating her disease.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once she's back on her feet, we'll hand her over to the federation.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I understand."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">The Mysterium will work day and night to find a cure.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If we don't have one fast, this kind of tragedy will keep happening.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you for your assistance.</Page>
