        <Page social="5">I am vexed by this creature, Nakarash. I can't deduce why he's so hard to kill. To their credit, the soldiers did their best, but he cut them down like so much chaff.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I won't lie to you, this will be a difficult battle. If you can kill {@LinkCreature:7#18#Nakarash}, we'll be one step closer to finishing our research. Then, perhaps, we can turn our attention to retaking this region for the federation.</Page>

        <Page social="5">You slew Nakarash? And you brought me a scale to study? I'm beginning to think your talents are wasted here in the field. You should be at the Legion of Arms training our finest soldiers!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks to you, my insanely intrepid companion and I can finish our research and return to the sanctuary of Allemantheia. Gratitude, &lt;PCNAME&gt;.</Page>

        <Page social="5">A piece of Nakarash's armor? Intriguing. You must be skilled indeed to take down a beast such as he.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We will study this carefully and add its strength to our own. You have our gratitude.</Page>
