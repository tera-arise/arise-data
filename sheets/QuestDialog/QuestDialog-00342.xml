        <Page social="4">If orcans are to blame for the crash, then it was {@linkcreature:13#1002#Acharak} who ordered it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We have tracked his movements for weeks, but never have so many orcans gathered in one place.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He must have overrun the Tainted Gorge Garrison, but a decisive blow will break their morale.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kill Acharak and take the Dark Claw tribe's talisman, a black feather. If Centurion Edan still lives, he will know what to do with it.</Page>
