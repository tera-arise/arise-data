        <Page social="0">Mysterium scholars in Blessing Basin asked for your aid after tales of your deeds etched themselves into ancient cenotaphs. You studied the cenotaphs and learned you were to face a great test. You faced the guardians of fate and met with the Seeress of the Gods, Mystel. She gave you a warning about the future and an ancient tome.</Page>

They're adamant about needing your assistance, but are more close-lipped than usual about their discovery.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The team is still in the field, so head west to Crossroads Camp. Be prepared for anything. This insistence on secrecy is unusual even for them, so I assume their request will be as well. Go and meet {@linkcreature:226#1025#Lilone}.</Page>
