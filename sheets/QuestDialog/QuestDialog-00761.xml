        <Page social="4">Kaidun! The name holds many meanings for we amani. Once he was a symbol of our glory and strength. Those days are long gone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kaidun emerged from the Citadel of Torment a mad, ruthless tyrant. He conquered Mount Tyrannasâ€”and without the sacrifice of our people, he'd be right here slaughtering us all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The battle has dragged on so long, we are in dire need of supplies. We have soldiers, but no way to arm them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bring us weapons. I don't care how. In fact, if you should pry them from the cold, dead hands of {@LinkCreature:32#1#Sihran fighters} and {@LinkCreature:32#2#tuwangi hornheads}, I'd be downright pleased.</Page>
