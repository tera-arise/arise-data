        <Page social="4">My sister! Have you seen my sister?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She ran off into the forest. We...we had an argument. She always comes back when she's calmed down, but it's been two days already!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They say the forest isn't safe anymore, but you look brave. Can you find my sister {@LinkCreature:202#1028#Jerelyn}?</Page>
