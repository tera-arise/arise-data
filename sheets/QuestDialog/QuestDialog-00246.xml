        <Page social="0">The nagas can hiss and moan about Dagon all they want, but they're not leaving Serpentis Isle if I have anything to say about it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm worried about the refugees on the eastern coast of the island, so I'm sending elements of Kaia's Sword to wipe them out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Head to Viper Camp and lend them your strength.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Yeah, Latas isn't the most diplomatic soldier here. But tongues get sharp when the mind gets dull, and we're all exhausted.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We've been trying to keep the Boan Strand, Kerozen Isle, and the Adderkin Jungle clear of hostiles, and it's just too much ground to cover. We'll be able to put you to good use.</Page>
