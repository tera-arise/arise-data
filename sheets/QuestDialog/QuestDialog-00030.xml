        <Page social="4">In peacetime, we'd just condemn this bridge and start over. It's barely better than a cold swim, if you know what I mean.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But try telling that to my bosses. Actually, speaking of telling things to my bosses...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The {@LinkCreature:2#1#redcaps} stole the parts I was supposed to use for the bridge undercarriage...and probably broke them. Will you retrieve the &lt;b&gt;bridge parts&lt;/b&gt; and bring them to Niklas, the foreman at Faevine Vale Camp? He can get replacements, and I'd rather not ask Balter.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Why would redcaps steal the parts? What was Siravon doing, if not watching the very parts he's supposed to install?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rhetorical question. I already know the answer: He's an idiot.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I guess I'll start repairing these parts. Did I mention that Siravon is an idiot?</Page>
