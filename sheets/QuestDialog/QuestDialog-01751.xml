        <Page social="0">After the Velika Banquet incident, Velik fell into a deep sleep.&lt;BR&gt;With the help of Mystel, you entered Velik’s dream, where you encountered and defeated a strange, giant butterfly. Then, in Velik's subconscious, you saw the people of Velika falling from the sky, trapped inside crystals—including the goddess herself. After you left the dream, Mystel warned that there was more.</Page>
