        <Page social="4">I've received a report from Tashaberia. Apparently something suspicious is going on. I'm not sure; the report I got was very disjointed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I've already sent an investigator named Elsta—catch up with him near the Free Brotherhood's encampment. He should have more information by now.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Oh, Cardis sent you, too?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All right, what I've figured out so far is that the {@linkcreature:19#4002#Lokian cleavers} and {@linkcreature:19#4004#Lokian swordlords} are powerful elite fighters. Also that I am not strong enough to fight them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So...you should probably do it. You'll need to collect their weapons so we can send them to Velika for examination.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Excellent work! I'll send these to Velika right away—along with a note of your distinguished service, of course.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please take this as a sign of our appreciation.</Page>
