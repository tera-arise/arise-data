Certainly, we can attack Lok's cultists...cut them off from the devan raiders.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Clearly, the cultists are supplying the devas with weapons and using them as shock troops, so we need to destroy their armory.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll work on finding hard proof of cultists' involvement, so Hendry can show it to the garrison commander in Velika.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile, you should go destroy those weapons! Come find me at the crossroads when you're done.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I'm on it."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
