        <Page social="4">In an effort to secure supply routes and move military units without argon interference, we employed castanic engineers to tunnel into Granarkus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll teleport you to {@LinkCreature:249#1015} when you're ready.

        <Page social="4">We just blasted the last of the rock a few hours ago.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The argons made regular supply and relief missions difficult to execute, particularly getting into and out of Kanstria.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What's that? A town?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4">Kanstria? Yeah. Lots of castanics settled there. I heard an elin call it "Little Castanica."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, the argons disrupted the flight platform, so they've been stranded there. I want you to take this flight stone to their flight manager. That'll get them going again.</Page>
