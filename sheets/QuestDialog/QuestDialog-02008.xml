        <Page social="4">I should probably ask one of the Hands to do this, but you're a thousand times more dependable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Would you mind going to Fyrmount today? If I send one of my own, I may never see them again. They'll either run scared or die painfully.</Page>

        <Page social="5">I can't believe she sent you to {@Rgn:4001#Fyrmount}!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What would've happened if we'd never met you? We'd probably all be dead.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I know I can be a real pain in the ass, but it's not an easy time to be alive. Just ask {@LinkCreature:63#3003#Elthienne}.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Elthienne promised a contact of ours that we'd take care of some of the threats in {@Rgn:4001#Fyrmount}, so hunt {@LinkCreature:4#1011#fangspawns} there. Oh, and they want proof of death. I have no idea what that means, so just bring back a toenail or something.</Page>

        <Page social="5">You know, {@LinkCreature:63#3003#Elthienne} isn't all that bad. I've probably said some things I shouldn't have.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She's a tough cookie. I think it's hard for two tough cookies to work so closely together. Especialy when one of them is, like, old and crumbling—there I go again! I just can't help myself!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think she knows we're talking about her. You should go check.</Page>
