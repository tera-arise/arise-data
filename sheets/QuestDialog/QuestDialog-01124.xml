        <Page social="10" voiceTypeId="0">Job well done, soldier.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's a relief that the Siege Weapon works.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But I'm afraid that won't be enough to stand against their cannons.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To prevent further losses, we tried to incapacitate their cannons, but failed every time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We need your help. Talk to {@LinkCreature:248#1032#Hazto} for details. He's out in the courtyard.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Three soldiers under my command died yesterday, and I want to recover their unit insignias for their families.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jared, Genevieve, and Misha deserved better, but I won't let their names be lost to the winds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But it's all I can do to hold this position. I can't fight my way through to their bodies. Think you can recover them for me?</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Thanks. I tried to keep the argons busy. Hope you didn't get too banged up.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I found out that an argon called the Magister controls the cannon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was like...the cannon was linked to their body or something.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"The Magister?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">A special type of Argonâ€”vicious and cunning.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But they've got the components we need. I firmly believe that you can take them. Please get them for the sake of my men.</Page>

        <Page social="6" voiceTypeId="0">That was no mean feat, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. Well done.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With those shapers dead, the cannons will sit silent for a while. Hopefully, that'll give me time to analyze its design.</Page>

        <Page social="0">The shapers never venture out without minions to protect them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And watch out for those cannons. There's no telling what will set them off.</Page>
