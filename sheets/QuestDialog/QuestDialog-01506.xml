I was trying to make it back to Ketrath, but I got cut off.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I escaped the orcans a little while ago...slipped away while they were distracted. But I saw where they took the rest of the unit...and I was going to get help. Looks like you're the help they need.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don't worry about me. I can make it now that the way is clear. Just get to the orcan camp and free my friends!</Page>

The orcans in the Lost Woods have a chain of command. Look for groups of them, wearing red seals. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kill some of those orcans, collect their seals, and show them to Lapau...if he's still alive. Nobody knows more about orcans. If anyone can explain the significance of the red seals, it's Lapau.</Page>

But being orcans, their tactics were crude and clumsy.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"But sadly effective."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

              voiceTypeId="0">Right. Listen, I've got a new assignment for you. I've got another scout deep in orcan-controlled territory, looking for a linchpinâ€”a weakness we can exploit to drive them out of the Lost Woods.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You're going to provide me with another diversion. Pull that off, and you'll have earned my respect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the meantime, here. Consider it a prize for getting here before me.</Page>
