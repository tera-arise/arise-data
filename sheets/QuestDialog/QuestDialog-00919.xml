        <Page social="5">Have you been out to the craters yet? The gods did that when the giants got too big for their giant britches.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But what's even more amazing are the diggers and boregolems that survived the Day of Fire. My theory is they dug themselves in, really deep. They can dig like anything.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I had me some of those arms of theirs, our work would be cut in half, and in half again! I don't suppose you'd like to help?</Page>
