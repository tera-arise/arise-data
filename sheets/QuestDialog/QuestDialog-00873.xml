        <Page social="6">Killian has sort of a weird fetish for torturing people. It turns my stomach, but facts are facts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bodies of his victims are lying all around here. I would like to pray over their belongings and put them to rest, but I can't possibly collect all the necklaces myself.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can you help me gather them up?</Page>
