        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">"The Sun shall await two... Through might and wisdom, they will awaken a long-lost hope." Greetings, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I have waited a long time to see you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My parents pushed me into the archive vaults when the god Balder died. His magic preserved us to serve his refuge and temple.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Only the children survived that day.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"You actually saw Balder?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">I was a child, so my memories are vague. I remember he was often sad, but beautiful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was too young to visit the temple, but I knew the ceremonies. You have earned this key.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you are ready, go see {@LinkCreature:230#1074$$Botak}. He will show you the entrance. Good luck.</Page>

        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">The key! At last.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The temple entrance is in the grotto behind me. Inside the temple, you will face its {@LinkCreature:425#8005#guardian}.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am sorry, but I do not know anything more.</Page>
