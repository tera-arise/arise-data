They'll be great help for sure.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I wish I could go with you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;, but I'm worried that Rogash might harm our people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll gather more information from Vogzu and go later. &lt;PCNAME&gt;, you go with Jelena and inform our troops outside.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Elleon went alone? Looks like he wants to make his move first after getting information from Vogzu.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But Elleon alone...&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Is there something wrong?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0">No, it's nothing. We should hurry.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think the base exit is over there. Let's go and look for Titus and Amarre.</Page>

        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Titus and Aurl found a camp for our people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I thought I would be safe since I was near the camp, but the nagas got me off guard so I had to run. But I found something interesting! Come and see.</Page>

I saw the nagas come and carry off the crystals.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I wonder why the nagas are collecting the crystals.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you can help me out investigating the crystals, we might figure something out about Exodor.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Hmm...the blue crystals are different secretions of the butterflies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To be exact, they've been ruminated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This must be one of their dietary activities...but why in the world would the nagas collect it?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Why?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What should we do next?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">I think it's quite obvious why the butterflies ruminate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But what I have to find out is why the nagas are collecting those crystals.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where are they taking the crystals to?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let's discuss this with Elleon first.</Page>
