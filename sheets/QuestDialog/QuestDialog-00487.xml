        <Page social="4">Yeah, I know. It's the same old story. "Return to the safety of the camp." I don't think so.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, ready to help?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I don't remember volunteering."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0">I volunteered you. I'm researching the civilization of the giants, but I can't find enough historical documents to get a full understanding it. However, the {@LinkCreature:18#17#ancient teraliths} are covered with inscriptions. I wonder if they'd help.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you'd collect some for me, I'd be grateful.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Oh, look at these inscriptions! They're exactly what I'd hoped.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These pictures will teach me a lot. Good work!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here, take this for your trouble. I know it's not much, but it's all I can get this far from camp.</Page>
