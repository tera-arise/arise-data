        <Page social="4">We're understrength and desperately afraid. People disappear overnight and no one sees them taken. Doesn't help that the woods aren't safe, either.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you're looking to do some good, we'll take it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Talk to Master Yedwin of the &lt;font color='0000ff'&gt;Explorer Guild&lt;/font&gt;.</Page>

        <Page social="4">The situation's grim. Between the disappearances and the unseelie, things are tough. We're isolated hereâ€”it's too dangerous to push through to Susurrus Woods or Amena Quatla.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We need basic supplies. Bring Thaqib some hyena hides and he can protect the troops better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can't miss the hyenas. They're lurking around the village.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Thanks. I can use these. I don't know what good it'll do, though. People disappear no matter how many soldiers we field.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kaia grant me courage. I don't want to live in fear.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Those hyenas make it tough for supplies to get to us or to the other outposts. Getting rid of them serves two goals.</Page>
