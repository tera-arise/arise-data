        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">I'm glad you're here. As near as anyone can tell, a mana fluctuation along the shoreline caused that freak storm. The water—and everything that was in it—are frozen solid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kennance at Glacial Bay Research Station is in charge of the mana gauges. She could use your help.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">&lt;PCNAME&gt;? Good. I heard you were in the area.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You've heard about our mana gauges, right? Okay, here's the problem: As soon as we installed the gauges, the undead moved in.</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">I never saw so many in one place.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unless I miss my guess, this is Thulsa's work.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"How can I help?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">We sent one of our researchers, Versa, to collect results from the gauges we put along the shore of Icefang Inlet, but she hasn't come back. Can you go look for her?</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Thank goodness! A soldier!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An {@LinkCreature:31#2#ossugon icelord} attacked me, and I had to flee. If it hadn't been for that bard, you'd be rescuing a corpse. She played her harp and the monsters just scattered!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, the {@LinkCreature:31#2#icelord} took the mana wave maps with the research data I've collected. Can you help me get them back? We need that information.</Page>

    <Text id="6" huntingZoneId="231" prevId="5" villagerId="1046">
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Thank you for your help! Do you think I could lean on you one more time?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I couldn't reach the last two mana gauges because of the icelords. Can you find them and fetch their results? Just follow this path up the hill. Once you retrieve the mana wave maps, take them to Matil at the Beacon Point Garrison.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When it comes to the study of necromancy, he has no equal in the Mysterium. Don't worry about me. I'll catch a ride back with the garrison soldiers.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Do you see that cyclone? Zenobia, goddess of storms, laid her lover Iannis to rest at its center. She has kept the waters calm over his grave so their descendants can reap the bounty of the sea.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"It's a sad story."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Not so sad as what Thulsa's followers have planned. They're using tombstones to concentrate his necromantic power around Iannis's crypt. They want to bring Iannis back...undead.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Zenobia froze the sea to stop it temporarily.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If only we knew more about Thulsa's magic, maybe we could find a more permanent solution.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I know someone!"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">A researcher? Then perhaps there's hope for Tempest Reach. Please help me. Tell your researcher friend what's happening, and find a way to stop Thulsa!</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">It's about time someone brought me those readouts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tombstones? A bard? How did she get anywhere near Icefang Inlet? Maybe she's one of Thulsa's spies.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Quite the opposite."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">They told me I was getting someone to help, not give me more work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But I won't pretend I'm not intrigued. If you can bring me some blood from drowned gula {@LinkCreature:31#14#bosuns} or {@LinkCreature:31#15#officers}, I can analyze the mana to see if it's gotten any stronger.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Hmm. Your so-called bard is right—something's definitely going on, and those "tombstones" are concentrating the mana somehow.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Do you know how to destroy them?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">Yes, but I don't think you're going to like it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Seraeno the Dark Caller is running the show with the Thulsans. You're going to have to kill this Seraeno to get the Onyx Breath, a black mana core, from him. Then you can use it on this seal to destroy those {@linkcreature:31#34#bloody tombstones}.</Page>
