        <Page social="4">Dhersik here has a theory that those oversized hydraneas are edible. I disagree.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They're the really big, bright fuschia flowers growing right out of the swamp water. They don't grow that big anywhere but here. The argons must have something to do with it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you bring me some, I'll only let her eat a tiny sliver. I promise.</Page>
