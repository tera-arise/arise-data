        <Page social="5">You've really been plugging away at the tuwangis! We really appreciate it, and welcome you to continue to help us. The {@LinkCreature:5#5#Tuwangi Blockheads} and the {@LinkCreature:5#6#Tuwangi Choppers} are next on the list.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Make sure to clear the way and let the others know that it's time to pull it back.</Page>
