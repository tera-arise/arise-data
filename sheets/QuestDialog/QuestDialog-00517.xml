        <Page social="4">I hear you're thinking about entering that cave. You are? Wonderful! For you, I mean. I mean I hear it's...great, but I wouldn't be excited for me that you're going in. That'd be dumb.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Although...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, as long as you're going in, it would be pretty neat if you could grab a few &lt;b&gt;cave mushroom spores&lt;/b&gt;. Just if you happen to see them, of course.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And then, maybe you could, I don't know, deliver them to Ruanal?</Page>
