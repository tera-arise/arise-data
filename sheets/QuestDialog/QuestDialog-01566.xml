        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">Perhaps you would be so kind as to satisfy my curiosity about you and your people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You clearly are not from Val Oriyn. So why have you come here?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;You explain about the demokrons' attack.&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">Who would have thought that the magic of the archdevans would spread so far...?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We have made many attempts to stop them, &lt;BR&gt;but it's not easy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We will do our best to help you stop the archdevas.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Tell me more about the Vault of Oriyn."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">The Vault of Oriyn is a special place where Oriyn's Arcana are kept, which contain enormous knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the help of Oriyn's Arcana, an answer can always be found, but... &lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"But?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">Anyone who wishes to read Oriyn's Arcana must first undergo Oriyn's trial.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You would be putting your life on the line.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you are prepared to do that, read the old book in front of you.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Okay."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

        <Page social="0">The companions passed Oriyn's trial in order to find the secret behind the Dreamstorm and the demokron invasion, but Dakuryon, who had been disguised as Madat, captured High Elder Verikam along with Oriyn's Arcana. In the process, Dakuryon became interested in Zolyn, who has resistance against dark magic.</Page>

        <Page social="4" voiceTypeId="0">I ask because Oriyn's knowledge does not manifest as riddles. A single glyph, with a meaning open to interpretation, with no context whatsoever?

        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">Ah, well then. Then, perhaps in that context, this glyph may make some sense.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This glyph can mean many things: visitor, foreigner, outlander...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;...stranger.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I...I think it means you, Verikam."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">He stayed behind to guard the entrance to the vault.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We should let him know what happened. He saw Madat as a kind of mentor, after all.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I will do that."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
