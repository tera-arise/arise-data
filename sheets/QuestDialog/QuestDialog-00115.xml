        <Page social="4">Oh dear, &lt;PCNAME&gt;, it looks like it's going to be even worse than we thought. Turns out, the tuwangi are planning to attack any non-tuwangi that comes onto the reservation! One of the {@LinkCreature:205#1006#Merchants} just went in there to trade a little while agoâ€”can you please go after him? Bring him back, or at least help him get out of there. His name is Boermas.</Page>
