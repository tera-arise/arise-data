        <Page social="0">Elleon gave you vital intelligence on how to enter Thulsa's Stronghold, the Ebon Tower. Elleon's way required a special keystone: a gem belonging to Killian, the god of terror.

        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">&lt;PCNAME&gt;—it looks like we'll be fighting side by side once again. Thulsa and Killian awakened Kelsaik, but you kept them from obtaining complete control.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kelsaik must be near Thulsa...which is worrisome, but it gives us an opportunity. Jelena and I know where Thulsa is: Vale of Spires, Lorcada.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let's talk in person. I'll see you at the blacksmith's workshop.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Elleon</Page>

We have a knack for attracting powerful enemies, don't we?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ever heard of an ancient stronghold called the Ebon Tower?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, Thulsa is there...maybe Kelsaik, too. But Thulsa has had only one visitor. Guess who?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Killian?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="1" voiceTypeId="0">Exactly! We need the gem on Killian's staff, or we can't get into the Ebon Tower.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And it's not gonna break my heart to take the gem off Killian's corpse.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So Killian first, then. He's in the Labyrinth of Terror. I will be your guide.</Page>
