        <Page social="4">Elsine's work requires a lot of mana. It wouldn't have been a problem if we had cores, but they're almost impossible to find in places like this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The good news is that the Cultists near the ruins, such as the {@LinkCreature:24#17#eldritch masters} and {@LinkCreature:24#18#skullcleavers}, have mana. Of course, their mana is tainted with evil, but purifying it is easy. Bring me their mana orbs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, they're not exactly orbs, but hearts. Either way, bring them to me.</Page>
