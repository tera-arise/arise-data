        <Page social="4">I didn't believe the rumors at first, but our scouts have confirmed it. Virkan is back.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thulsa's necromancy brought back Virkan the Slayer, and he wanders the halls of the furnace even now. Just as he did in life, when he wandered Shara, searching for a worthy opponent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Virkan disappeared when our whole continent had no one worthy to face him. And now he's back. And probably looking for you.</Page>
