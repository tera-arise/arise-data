        <Page social="5">Pay attention nowâ€”this isn't an operation for keeners. I've found an arena in Sand Wind Village where the kulkari force prisoners, slaves, and even other kulkari to fight monsters.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The worst is called {@LinkCreature:24#5001#Merkaratos}. We're going to kill it and deprive the buggers of their bloody fun. And by "we," I mean you and whoever you can convince to come along. Much as I want to join in the fun, I have another scouting mission to attend to.</Page>
