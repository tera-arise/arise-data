        <Page social="4">The argons were up to something here in Raga Shadiâ€”I just know it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not many clues, though. Just the thick, keratinized skin of {@LinkCreature:46#303#argonomorph blood fiends}. It's a grisly task, but could you gather some, um, "fresh" skin so I can compare with the, um, "vintage" samples I have?</Page>

        <Page social="4">Now I get to employ the taxidermy skills my uncle taught me. Not exactly how I thought I'd put that skill to use.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Raga Evala needs your help more than I do here...unless you were a taxidermist before the war? No? I thought not.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bring them this. It's a simple wildflower that's been argonized. Creepy, but rather interesting.</Page>

        <Page social="4">You have an intact argonized wildflower? So far we've just found fragments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The argons are clearly capable of transforming the vegetation of an entire region, but we don't know how they do it, much less how to stop it.</Page>
