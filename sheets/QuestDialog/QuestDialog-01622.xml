        <Page social="4">&lt;PCNAME&gt;! I-I wanted to save her. I wanted to protect Zolyn, but I failed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My heart feels so heavy. I'm no hero. I just like to tinker with mechanical things. It's my fault she was captured.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"No, it's not."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="4">Yes, it is. She needed a hero, not a friend.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I bet we can find her together, though. You're strong and I'm brave, at least a little bit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let's get these wagons moving, then find Zolyn.</Page>
