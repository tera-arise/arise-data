        <Page social="4">So it's &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I've heard that you're doing extraordinarily well over here. As you can see, there are lots of violent Terrons running around this place. They are usually not that threatening, but more annoying I would say. However, they suddenly became violent and are a serious threat to the researchers. Look at Kamarnu. He took refuge here after he got injured.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We cannot let these Terrons run like this anymore. Kill the {@LinkCreature:13#302#Terron Ringleaders} in the vicinity and bring back the petals from their heads as proof of their deaths.</Page>
