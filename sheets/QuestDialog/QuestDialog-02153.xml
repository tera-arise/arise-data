If it can't be destroyed from outside then there's got to be another way, right?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Is there another way?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

        <Page social="0">There are some captured butterflies in this box. &lt;BR&gt;If you release them, you can fly to Exodor on them.</Page>

You should be able to stop Exodor from the inside.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Titus and Amarre should be useful. Please take them with you and find a way to stop Exodor.</Page>
