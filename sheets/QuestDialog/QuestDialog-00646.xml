        <Page social="4">All Cultists are annoying, but the worst is the {@LinkCreature:25#1051#skeletal pikemen}. They keep coming after us, even after losing all their limbs. I guess the dead don't feel pain, but looking at their limbless bodies squirming is just...creepy. The Atel Akaad stuck frenzied cores in them. It's what's keeping them moving.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Go collect the cores, then bring them to Orlaith at Scholar's Refuge.</Page>
