        <Page social="4">Elleon's brother, Leander, leads the search effort from his camp far to the south. Unlike his brother—and unlike you, judging from that weapon—Leander's a scholar by profession, not a soldier.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nobody wants to find Elleon more than I do, but we've got a whole island to reclaim—and if Elleon's dead, then that's the best way to honor his memory.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let's keep you moving. Report to &lt;font color='#660000'&gt;Centurion Kishale&lt;/font&gt; at the Northern Checkpoint, &lt;PCCLASS:lcase&gt;.</Page>

        <Page social="4">Survivors from the first demon attack are always welcome—the new recruits have no idea how danger can arrive in a heartbeat. Everyone clings to hope that Elleon lives, but you saw those demons firsthand. We cling to hope, not certainty.</Page>
