        <Page social="4">I can't! It's just...too much! Better I never enlisted. Better I'd died in the Cult's first attack!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lost my uncle and his family when the Cult took over. Joined the army to help my people. Other uncle's in the cult himself. Those fields? Full of people I know. Cult kidnaps anyone they can and kills those who won't join!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I can't. Can't kill them. They're my blood! I'm no coward, but Nature weeps at this!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These {@LinkCreature:17#300580#enthralled workers} aren't your folk. They have to die. If you'll do it mercifully, I'll be in your debt.</Page>
