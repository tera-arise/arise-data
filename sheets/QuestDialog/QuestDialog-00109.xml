        <Page social="0">If you happen to pass through Lumbertown, talk to Tomba. He's from Tuwangi Mire, and there's some sort of crisis over there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mire is a unique place, so I suggest you explore it regardless.&lt;BR&gt;{@LinkCreature:60#1099} can guide you there.</Page>

        <Page social="0">Me from place you call Tuwangi Mire. Many good tuwangis live there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But tuwangis crazy now. Tuwangis drive out humans and want to be kings and queens of world. Me different. Me not like fighting. Tuwangis lose if fight against outsiders.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Me send you place called Marshlands. Go meet {@LinkCreature:205#1017#Rathe}. Tell Rathe you come to stop tuwangis.</Page>

        <Page social="5">The local tuwangis are wailing as if the world's about to come to an end, and they've been begging everyone carrying a weapon to come to the mire.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But in reality, it's nothing but boredom here in Tuwangi Mire. The tuwangi here are pretty docileâ€”it's the ones that left the area and came back that you have to worry about.</Page>
