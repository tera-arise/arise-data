I explained to my son that I had help catching dinner, but he was so excited about the eels that he ran out and started telling people what a great angler I am.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hate to ask, but can you help me again?&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"What do you need?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

              voiceTypeId="0">I thought that if we caught the biggest fish possible from this Fishery, the Fairy Snakehead, he'll stop expecting more from me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I know this is a tremendous favor, but I'll definitely reward you for your efforts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I can also give you a little advice-if you want to catch a Big-Ass Fish, you have to do it yourself. They're too crafty to fall for a simple lure on a timer.</Page>
