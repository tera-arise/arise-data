All of these dead baraka must've been ambushed!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is bad, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. If they died without seeing the faces of their killers, they'll come back as vengeful spectres, and haunt this road forever!

Humor me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll have Joakim and Donakim gather stones to build a grave marker.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile, you use stones from around the baraka corpses to collect their soulsâ€”and then cleanse yourself in sheep's blood, so that the soldiers' soul-scent doesn't linger on you. Otherwise they'll haunt you for the rest of your days.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Uh, yeah. We can't have that."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
