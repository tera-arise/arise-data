        <Page social="4">Yeah, I'll pay to have you bug someone else, but it's pay, not a handout.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the pirates chased me here, I had to jettison some of my cargo to stay ahead of them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It washed up on the beach, just down that staircase east of the village.
