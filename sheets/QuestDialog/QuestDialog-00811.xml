It used to be so easy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We had a good rapport with the wendigosâ€”at least until the giants came.

Many miners were killed and quite a few eldritch shards stolen.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We need you to strike back and recover the shards. Kill the {@LinkCreature:34#300#Junaidar thieves}, {@LinkCreature:34#400#scourges}, and {@LinkCreature:34#310#bandits}, and retrieve their shard packs.</Page>

These remarkable crystals are used in magical shields.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the Mysterium can make it practical, each federation city will be guarded by such a device.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We'll see that the miners' families are compensated for what you recovered.</Page>
