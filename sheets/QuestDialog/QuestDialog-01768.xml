I get too excited sometimes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ruby Durignite is very rare, it makes sense that you couldn't find more.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Besides, repairing this failed experiment would make no difference. I need to go back to the drawing board.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll get back to you when I have a new design, then we'll take our revenge.</Page>
