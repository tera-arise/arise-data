        <Page social="4">That rune! By Kaia's mercy, I thought all of those were lost to time!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What you have in your hands is a knowledge rune, used by ancient amani master craftsmen to record their most powerful designs. My own family has done quite well translating and applying these to modern weapons and armor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With your permission, may I examine the document?</Page>

        <Page social="4">Fantastic. These designs...if your skill is sufficient to the task, you will soon craft some remarkable things.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have translated the document so that you can upgrade your equipment. I look forward fighting alongside you someday, and seeing the results.</Page>
