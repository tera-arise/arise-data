        <Page social="4">Balrug's going to have to handle the apprentices himself for a few days. I can't go back, not yet. I'm short of funds and need to bring a big shipment back to town.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Perhaps I could help."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="5">I wasn't asking for charity! I'm just—blast!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Look, my daughter's ill—very ill. The healers say she'll live if she can get a special medicine from the Mysterium, but it's bloody expensive. If I can bring enough fine hides in, I can just afford it. If you're serious about helping, get after the sabertooths. I need perfect, pristine hides.</Page>
