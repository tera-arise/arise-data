        <Page social="4">I don't care what Dulari says. Walking trees are not natural in any way. And the ones here are even creepier than those by his campsite. Back home we've got nothing like these {@LinkCreature:13#300932#Horned Ghilliedhus}.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jirash got first pick of these assignments, and he doesn't care at all that I've got to push the ghilliedhus back from our perimeter as often as is necessary.
