        <Page social="4">Not far from here is another scout, {@LinkCreature:203#1010#Rasima}. She's as tough as they come, but she's all alone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She'd never ask for help, she's all into having altitude, but she'll take it if it's offered. And bring her something to drink!</Page>

        <Page social="4">Yes, I'm all aloneâ€”now. My partner, Keleth, and I were discovered while scouting around. We fought hard, but he bought my escape with his life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I honor his sacrifice but need a favor. Bring back his {@LinkCreature:203#1029#ring} that I might return them to his home and thank his family.</Page>

        <Page social="4">I remember this ring. Keleth was very proud of such a humble band.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is perfect. Such a token will mean much to his loved ones. Thank you for this. May the Shieldmaiden protect you in all your battles!</Page>
