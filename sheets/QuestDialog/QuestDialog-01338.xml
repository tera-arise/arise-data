        <Page social="4">The path to the Staff of Isren is blocked by orisks. They're not normally found in this area, so someone wants us to stay as far from the staff as possible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We need to reach the staff. I don't care if you lure them away with steamcakes and firewhiskey, but dead or alive, they've got to go.</Page>
