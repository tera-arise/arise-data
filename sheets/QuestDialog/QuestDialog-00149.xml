        <Page social="5">When you were over dealing with the Gutrend escorts, did you happen to run into a guard named {@LinkCreature:206#1020#Dakona}? She's guarding the temporary outpost north of Echo Ranch. The only one there, actually.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Truth be told, I'm worried about her. It's hard to be the only guard in an area.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could you maybe check on her?</Page>
